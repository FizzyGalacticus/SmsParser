# SmsParser
### Purpose
This project was created in order to help a friend of mine format his backed up SMS messages in a nice readable manner. Because this also happened to be a legal requirement, I want to make sure that the messages can be exported into several different formats as necessary.

### Development
Because I needed to get something going quickly, and it needed to be  platform independant, I decided to write this in Java using the Swing framework. This makes it possible for me to just drag and drop the visual components in an IDE and just leaves the logic of each function for me to write.

### License
I am currently looking into my options as far as licensing goes, as the libraries that I'm using all use different open source licenses. So far we have:

*   [itextpdf](http://itextpdf.com) - Uses AGPL License
*   [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) - Uses Apache2.0 License
*   [JSON-Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) - Uses JSON License

### Donations
Not a requirement, but I would be thankful. Any donations will help me have more time to add features to and polish this project, as well as continue the pursuit of my degree.
